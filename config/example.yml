# This configuration defines how Modbus devices are polled
# and how their registers are exposed as Prometheus metrics.
#
# The exporter assumes the configuration is correct and does not
# attempt to infer offsets, datatypes, or scaling automatically.


# Supported datatypes (case-sensitive):
#
# Integer:
#   - U8       : Unsigned 8-bit (low byte)
#   - U16      : Unsigned 16-bit, big-endian
#   - S16      : Signed 16-bit, big-endian
#   - U32      : Unsigned 32-bit, big-endian
#   - S32      : Signed 32-bit, big-endian
#   - U32LE    : Unsigned 32-bit, little-endian by word (CDAB)
#   - S32LE    : Signed 32-bit, little-endian by word
#   - U64BE    : Unsigned 64-bit, big-endian
#   - S64BE    : Signed 64-bit, big-endian
#
# Float:
#   - F32BE    : Float32, big-endian (ABCD)
#   - F32LE    : Float32, little-endian by word (CDAB)
#   - F32CDAB  : Float32, word-swapped
#   - F32BADC  : Float32, byte-swapped
#   - F64BE    : Float64, big-endian
#
# String:
#   - UTF8     : C-style UTF-8 string (NUL-terminated / padded)
#
# Notes:
# - Modbus registers are 16-bit words.
# - "words" indicates how many 16-bit registers are read.
# - Offset is applied as: effective_register = register - offset

# Offset semantics:
# - Offset is applied per slave, not per device.
# - Effective Modbus address is computed as:
#     effective_register = register - offset
# - Offset depends on how the vendor documents register maps.
#   Some devices mix 0-based and 1-based addressing across register ranges.
# - It is the user's responsibility to set the correct offset for each slave.

# Words vs datatype:
# - words must match the size required by datatype:
#     * 1 word  -> U8, U16, S16
#     * 2 words -> U32, S32, U32LE, F32*
#     * 4 words -> U64BE, S64BE, F64BE
# - Mismatched word counts may result in incorrect values.

# UTF8 datatype:
# - UTF8 registers are read and decoded correctly,
#   but are NOT exported as Prometheus metrics.
# - Prometheus only supports numeric samples.
# - UTF8 registers may be used for debugging or future metadata endpoints.

# Gain:
# - Gain is applied after decoding the raw register value.
# - Final value = decoded_value * gain
# - Use gain to apply scaling factors documented by the vendor.
